# motivation for taskseq
The idea of the task sequencer is to enable a user to set up a list of tasks with associated times which they can then play back in 'sequence.'
It started as a simple way to organize a stretching routine.  Automating the stretch count for each movement should optimize focus and consistency by providing simple and intuitive feedback.

# background
This repo serves as an active learning experience for the developer.  If you happen upon this repo and wish to provide feedback, it is more than welcome.  At the moment the app is in a primitive development phase and is somewhat unorganized in its progress.

# goals
The end goal is to produce a simple app that will satisfy the following requirements:
- logical file and code structure
- ability to create, edit, view, and delete sequences as well as individual tasks
- precise macro and micro timers for every task and sequence
- intuitive navigation

# ideas
In the process of developing come many new ideas...
- configurable settings for color schemes, etc...
- original sounds and animations for user experience
- visual description of tasks via associated images
- basic statistics for tracking consistency of sequence completions
